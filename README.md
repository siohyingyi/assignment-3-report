Through this industrial talk by Credence, I had learn more detail about the role of an analyst , the technology used for analytics and the career paths in analytics.
There are certain career that related to analytics for example business analyst, data architect, data scientist, data analyst, data engineer and BI Developer.
Through this talk I had know more detail about the job scope for each position and I felt motivated to be enrolled into this field.

In order to become a software development in the future, I will start self learning in programming language which commonly used in software development. 
For instance, Python, JavaScript, Java, and C#. I will learn the syntax, data structures and algorithms of these language from now so that I can master it in the future because practise makes perfect.
Besides, I will start develop my soft skills such as communication, teamwork and problem-solving because it is crucial in software development roles. 
For example, teamwork and communication is essential in developing a software as we need to work in a team to make the project done efficiently. A project might need skills and techniques
from different specialty and for sure the capability of a single person is rarely to meet the requirements requested by the clients.
Lastly, I will also try to contribute to open source projects to gain practical experience and collaborate with other developers.
